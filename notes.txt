sea-orm-cli migrate generate [Table name]

e.g sea-orm-cli migrate generate add_created_at__to_post



use the command below to initialise sea-orm-cli migration
sea-orm-cli migrate init

use the command to run the sea-orm migration
sea-orm-cli migrate up
migrate fresh removes all the existing table and then re-run the migration

to generate entity use the command, Note that you manually create Cargo.toml file for the entity
# Generate entity files of database `bakery` to `entity/src`
sea-orm-cli generate entity -u protocol://username:password@localhost/bakery -o entity/src
You can remove "-u protocol://username:password@localhost/bakery" if you already have that set as an env var
